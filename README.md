# urlPdfDownloader
I was downloading a lot of pdf files one day when I had the notion to develop a script to make this work simpler. This script may be used to download pdf files that have the following pattern: xxxx.xxxxxx.xxx/xxx/.../xxx/xxxxaNumber.pdf. We can make more in the future, but for now, this is the chosen pattern.
